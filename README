# Data files Bundles for CMU-Sphinx

This source repository only holds the pom.xml file and folder structure of this bundle.

To avoid loading subversion repository with large binary files this artifact has to be build and deployed manually to retrieve precomputed models from other sites.


## Downloading the CMU-Sphinx acoustic and language model 

The CMU-Sphinx models are downloaded as dependency unpacked and repacked to stanbol repository

    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots

This url is defined as property in the 'pom.xml'
## NOTE

Using this bundles is only an alternative of manually copying the required OpenNLP models to the '{stanbol-installation}/sling/datafiles'.

In addition model files in this folder have precedence to models provided by this bundle.
